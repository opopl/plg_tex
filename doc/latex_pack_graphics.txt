3 Standard Interface
3.1	Graphics Inclusion

	\includegraphics *[ llx,lly ][ urx,ury ]{ file }
	Include a graphics file.

If * is present, then the graphic is ‘clipped’ to the size specified. If * is omitted,
then any part of the graphic that is outside the specified ‘bounding box’ will over-
print the surrounding text.

If the optional arguments are omitted, then the size of the graphic will be
de- termined by reading an external file as described below. If [ urx,ury ] is
present, then it should specify the coordinates of the top right corner of the
image, as a pair of TEX dimensions. If the units are omitted they default to
bp. So [1in,1in] and [72,72] are equivalent. If only one optional argument
appears, the lower left corner of the image is assumed to be at [0,0].
Otherwise [ llx,lly ] may be used to specify the coordinates of this point.

	\graphicspath { dir-list }

This optional declaration may be used to specify a list of directories in
which to search for graphics files. The format is as for the L TEX 2ε
primitive \input@path, a list of directories, each in a {} group (even if
there is only one in the list). For example: \graphicspath{{eps/}{tiff/}}
would cause the system to look in the subdirectories eps and tiff of the
current directory. The default setting of this


3.2 Rotation

*\rotatebox*
	\rotatebox { angle }{ text }
	Rotate text angle degrees anti-clockwise. Normally the rotation is about the left-
	hand end of the baseline of text.

3.3 Scaling

*\scalebox*

	\scalebox { h-scale }[ v-scale ]{ text }
	Scale text by the specified amounts. If v-scale is omitted, the vertical scale factor
	is the same as the horizontal one.

*\resizebox*

	\resizebox *{ h-length }{ v-length }{ text }
	Scale text so that the width is h-length. If ! is used as either length argument, the
	other argument is used to determine a scale factor that is used in both directions.

Normally v-length refers to the height of the box, but in the star form, it
refers A to the ‘height + depth’. As normal for L TEX 2ε box length arguments,
\height, \width,
