\kern 								  *\kern* *kern*

Synopsis: 

	\kern<dimen>

Description:

	THIS command adds a kern item with the specified dimension to the current
	list [280]. A \kern specifies vertical spacing in vertical mode and horizontal
	spacing in horizontal [87] or math [168] mode. Also, a kern is similar to glue
	except it cannot stretch or shrink. TeX will not break a line at a kern,
	unless the kern is immediately followed by glue [75]. The hyphenation
	algorithm distinguishes between implicit kern items (i.e., kerns inserted by
	TeX because of information stored with the current font) [454] and explicit
	kern items (i.e., ones added with \kern) [306].

Example:

  1. A kern may be used \kern0.25in anywhere.\par
  2. \kern0.25in However, the results may be unexpected if the mode is wrong.\par
  3. \noindent\kern0.25in See what I mean?

Produces: See typeset version.

Comments:

    The \kern on line 1 is in the middle of a paragraph and so adds horizontal space.
    The \par at the end of line 1 ends the paragraph. Thus, the kern at the start of line 2 is in vertical mode and so adds vertical space.
    The \noindent at the start of line 3 begins a new paragraph so the following \kern adds horizontal space.

\leaders 								*\leaders*

Synopsis:

	\leaders<box or rule><glue>

Description:

	LEADERS consist of a box and some glue. Copies of the box are used to fill the
	space specified by the glue [223]. Leaders made with \leaders are aligned
	[224]. A rule may be used in place of a box. This allows \hrule to make a
	horizontal line in horizontal mode [224-225].
