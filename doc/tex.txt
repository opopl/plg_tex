Synopsis: 

    \kern<dimen>

Description:

    THIS command adds a kern item with the specified dimension to the current
    list [280]. A \kern specifies vertical spacing in vertical mode and horizontal
    spacing in horizontal [87] or math [168] mode. Also, a kern is similar to glue
    except it cannot stretch or shrink. TeX will not break a line at a kern,
    unless the kern is immediately followed by glue [75]. The hyphenation
    algorithm distinguishes between implicit kern items (i.e., kerns inserted by
    TeX because of information stored with the current font) [454] and explicit
    kern items (i.e., ones added with \kern) [306].

Example:

  1. A kern may be used \kern0.25in anywhere.\par
  2. \kern0.25in However, the results may be unexpected if the mode is wrong.\par
  3. \noindent\kern0.25in See what I mean?

Produces: See typeset version.

Comments:

    The \kern on line 1 is in the middle of a paragraph and so adds horizontal space.
    The \par at the end of line 1 ends the paragraph. Thus, the kern at the start of line 2 is in vertical mode and so adds vertical space.
    The \noindent at the start of line 3 begins a new paragraph so the following \kern adds horizontal space.

\leaders                                *\leaders*

Synopsis:

    \leaders<box or rule><glue>

Description:

    LEADERS consist of a box and some glue. Copies of the box are used to fill the
    space specified by the glue [223]. Leaders made with \leaders are aligned
    [224]. A rule may be used in place of a box. This allows \hrule to make a
    horizontal line in horizontal mode [224-225].

Example:

     \def\sampletocB#1#2%
     {%
          \hbox to 3in
          {%
               #1% 0.0625 makes 16 dots per inch.
               \leaders
                    \hbox to 0.0625in{\hfil.\hfil}
                    \hfill
               \hbox to 0.25in{\hfil #2}%
           }
     }
     \def\sampleheader#1%
     {%
          \hbox to 3in
          {%
               {\it #1}%
               \kern3pt
               \leaders
                    \hrule height 0.25pt
                    \hfill
          }
     }
     \sampletocB{}{100}% Count the dots. There are 44.
     \sampletocB{Strangers and Brothers}{116}
     \sampletocB{The Age of Reason}{178}
     \sampleheader{Strangers And Brothers}
     \sampleheader{The Age of Reason}

Comments:

    This illustrates two common uses of leaders: the table of contents and page headers.
